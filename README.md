# GitHub Repository Star Analysis Script

## Overview
This Python script analyzes GitHub repositories to identify suspicious stargazing activities. It focuses on detecting repositories that might have artificially inflated their star counts, potentially indicating inauthentic popularity.

## Features
The script performs a detailed analysis of GitHub repositories based on various criteria to flag potentially suspicious activities. The key features include:

1. **Star Time Analysis**: Analyzes the time pattern of stars received by a repository to detect if a significant number of them were given within a short time frame, which might indicate artificial boosting.
2. **User Profile Analysis**: Assesses the profiles of users who starred the repository. 

## Setup and Execution
1. Install the required Python packages.
2. Set up the `.env` file with your GitHub Access Token.
3. Prepare a text file with a list of repositories to analyze.
4. Run the script: `python <script_name>.py`
