GitHub Repository Star Analysis Script
Overview
This Python script is designed to analyze GitHub repositories to identify suspicious stargazing activities. It focuses on detecting repositories that might have artificially inflated their star counts, potentially indicating inauthentic popularity.

Features
The script performs a detailed analysis of GitHub repositories based on various criteria to flag potentially suspicious activities. The key features include:

Star Time Analysis: Analyzes the time pattern of stars received by a repository to detect if a significant number of them were given within a short time frame, which might indicate artificial boosting.
User Profile Analysis: Assesses the profiles of users who starred the repository. Profiles with minimal activity or details are considered in the evaluation of suspicious activities.
Repository Star Count: Evaluates repositories based on their total star count and the pattern of receiving these stars.
Criteria for Suspicion
The script uses several criteria to determine if a repository's star activity is suspicious:

A large number of stars received within a short, configurable time window (default is 12 hours).
A high percentage of stars from users with profiles indicating minimal GitHub activity (e.g., fewer than 2 repositories, fewer than 2 followers).
Configurable thresholds for the percentage of stars within the time window and the percentage of similar users that flag a repository as suspicious.
Usage
Set the required environment variables, including the GitHub Access Token.
Configure the thresholds and time window as per your analysis needs.
Run the script with a list of GitHub repositories to analyze.
Logs and Reporting
Detailed Analysis Logs: Logs detailed information about the star pattern and user profile analysis.
Summary Logs: Provides a concise summary, flagging repositories as suspicious or not, based on the analysis.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Requests library
Python-dotenv library (for environment variable management)
Setup and Execution
Install the required Python packages.
Set up the .env file with your GitHub Access Token.
Prepare a text file with a list of repositories to analyze.
Run the script: python <script_name>.py
