# GitHub Repository Star Analysis

## Overview
This Python script analyzes GitHub repositories to identify suspicious stargazing activities. It focuses on detecting repositories that might have artificially inflated their star counts, potentially indicating inauthentic popularity.

## Features
The script offers a comprehensive analysis of GitHub repositories, employing multiple dimensions to uncover suspicious star activities. Its key features include:

1. **Star Time Analysis**: This feature examines the timing and distribution of GitHub stars to identify abnormal patterns indicative of artificial popularity. It analyzes when each star is awarded to a repository and searches for any possible red flags. These red flags may include a sudden spike in stars within a brief period, particularly when a significant portion of the repository's total stars are accumulated during that spike. This suggests artificial inflation by bots or paid services.

2. **User Profile Analysis**: This aspect evaluates the characteristics of users who have starred the repository. It examines indicators like the age of accounts, their activity patterns, and the diversity of their interactions on GitHub. This analysis helps in identifying profiles that exhibit traits commonly associated with artificial boosting activities.

3. **Graphical Visualization**: The script includes a feature for visualizing star patterns over time. This graphical representation allows users to easily spot irregularities in the star-giving trend, further aiding in the detection of suspicious activities.


## Setup and Execution
1. Ensure Python and necessary packages are installed.
2. Configure your environment with a GitHub Access Token in the `.env` file.
3. List the GitHub repositories you wish to analyze in a text file.
4. Execute the script using: `python <script_name>.py`


## Disclaimer:

While this tool provides insightful analysis and can effectively highlight patterns indicative of suspicious activities, it's important to understand that the results are not definitive proof of misconduct. The nature of data analysis, especially in complex environments like GitHub, involves dealing with probabilities and patterns rather than absolute certainties.
Therefore, our tool should be seen as offering strong indicators and valuable insights, rather than conclusive evidence, about a repository's star activity.
We encourage users to consider these findings as part of a broader assessment when evaluating the authenticity of a repository's popularity.
